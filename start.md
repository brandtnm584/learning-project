## The Ribbon

The ribbon in Excel is where you will find the majority of options to edit the worksheet. The ribbon looks like this:

The home tab largely covers the formatting of text and other parts of the workbook. You will most likely stay on this tab of the ribbon most often when working with Excel.
## Filling rows and columns

The boxes (cells) in excel are divided into **2** positional names. Rows and Columns. Rows are assigned a name by their *number* on the left hand side. Columns are assigned a *letter* from the top of the view. 

## Navigation

When navigating microsoft excel, you can use either the mouse to click from cell to cell, or use the arrow keys.
