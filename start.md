# Excel Basics

## The Ribbon

The ribbon in Excel is where you will find the majority of options to edit the worksheet. The ribbon looks like this:

The home tab largely covers the formatting of text and other parts of the workbook. You will most likely stay on this tab of the ribbon most often when working with Excel. The home tab is split into serveral sections, called groups. The clipboard group covers commands related to copying and pasting text into the workbork. The font group covers the theming of text, which we will cover in a later section. The Allignment group invovles the placement of text within a cell and how the text is alligned. The number group changes the formatting that numbers take, for example, adding a $ to prices or turning 121912 into 12/19/12. Styles and Cells cover ways to format the cells directly, not the text they contain. The editing tab contains some commonly used functions to make your life easier when working with Excel. 

### Insert

![Insert Tab](images/insert.png)

The insert tab largely covers functions related to inserting charts and other decorative items to a worksheet. The insert tab is broken down into smaller groups that all serve a similar purpose, the addition of an item to the worksheet. Pictures, Shapes, Icons, Models, Charts, Sparklines, Filters, Links, Text, and Symbols are all examples of items that can be added to a workbook from within this section. 

### Page Layout

The page layout menu covers functions related to formatting the workbork for printing. Within this section of the ribbon, you can adjust the margin, orientation, size, and area that will be printed when you print off the workbork. This section will be most useful when you need to print off a copy of work your work onto physical paper. 

### Data

![Data](images/data.png)

The data menu largely covers the inclusion of data from other sources and filtering the existing data. Using this menu, you can import data into the workbook from external sources (local/web) or from another workbook. The other groups on this bar can help you sort and filter this data to make sure it's laid out opitmally and does not contain junk data. 

## Rows and columns

The boxes (cells) in excel are divided into **2** positional names. Rows and Columns. Rows are assigned a name by their *number* on the left hand side. Columns are assigned a *letter* from the top of the view. Knowing this is important, because you will be frequently using ranges like A16:D34 when editing tables. 

## Navigation

When navigating Microsoft Excel, you can use either the mouse to click from cell to cell, or use the arrow keys. 

## Charts & Tables
Charts and Tables are designed to give the user a unique view of the data you've entered in your workbook. This can be stylized in many ways using the design tab that appears when you create a chart or table. 

## Working with text
>Text can be customised in several ways, most commonly by: 
>- Font
>- Text Size
>- Color
>- Misc Formatting.

# Formulas
Formulas are a very power tool in excel. This is where the most skill expression can be shown. I will only be covering the basics of formulas here, but I highly enourage to look into what these tools can do if you're using it in the workplace. 

## SUM

## AVERAGE

## MOD
